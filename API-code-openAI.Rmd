This script shows how to tap into the Open AI API. To execute this you first need to register on [https://openai.com/blog/openai-api](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api), and you also need to insert a payment method and pay some amount to the API. The API usage is not expensive and a couple of francs are sufficient for some testing. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)

# Authentication
APIkey <- readLines("openai_key.txt")   # place your API key in a .txt file
bearer <- stringr::str_c("Authorization: Bearer ", APIkey)
```

# Text generation endpoints

[Text generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation)
You input some text as a prompt, and the API will return a text completion that attempts to match whatever instructions or context you gave it.
From the documentation, I see that the API works with POST requests.

```{r}
r <- httr::POST(
  url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions", 
  content_type("application/json"), 
  add_headers(Authorization = paste("Bearer", APIkey, sep = " ")), 
  body = list(
    model = "gpt-4o", 
    # messages is a list of lists
    messages = list(
      list(role = "system", 
           content = "Write a short sonet about data mining in R in Swiss German"))
      ), 
  encode = "json"
  )
content(r)
cat(content(r)$choices[[1]]$message$content)
```

# Image generation (DALL-E)

[Intro to image generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/usage)

```{r}
url <- "https://api.openai.com/v1/images/generations"

r <- httr::POST(
  url = url, 
  content_type("application/json"), 
  add_headers(Authorization = paste("Bearer", APIkey, sep = " ")), 
  body = list(
    model = "dall-e-3", 
    prompt = "Mount Pilatus does data mining using R", 
    n = 1,
    size = "1024x1024"), encode = "json"
  )
browseURL(content(r)$data[[1]]$url)


```
