Objective. Learn how to navigate through API documentations and large lists of data. 

In this exercise we set up a few GET requests exploring the Spotify API. 
We will scrape:  

1. The list of categories of music in Switzerland.  

2. The playlists for a given category.   

3. The songs for a given playlist.   


# Authentication process

The authentication is quite elaborate. 

The  process is described at [this link](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/). There are four possible ways, we choose "Client Credentials", which is explained [here](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/client-credentials/). 

Download the credentials (client ID and the client secret) by placing them in a csv file named `credentials.csv`. 
You can use Excel to this end.  

Next, the [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/code-flow/) says: "The first step is to send a POST request to the `/api/token` endpoint of the Spotify OAuth 2.0 Service with the following parameters...

Here I load the credentials and make the POST request as described in the documentation. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(httr)
library(rvest)

# Set up your credentials
spotify_cred <- readr::read_csv(file = here::here("credentials.csv"))
client_id <- spotify_cred$clientID
client_secret <-  spotify_cred$secret

response <-  httr::POST(
  url = 'https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token',
  accept_json(),
#  authenticate(user = client_id, password = client_secret),    # This would also be OK.
  body = list(grant_type = 'client_credentials',        # This is required, check doc
              client_id = client_id,                     # Credentials
              client_secret = client_secret, 
              content_type = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"),   
  encode = 'form', 
verbose()
)

# Extract content from the call and get access token as described in the docs:
content <- httr::content(response)
token <- content$access_token

```

We got the token. Next in ["Use access token"](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/use-access-token/), I read: Authorization: (Required).  Valid access token following the format: Bearer <Access Token>

So we have to create this `"Bearer `" string before the access token. 

```{r}
authorization_header <- str_c(content$token_type, content$access_token, sep = " ")
```



Get Spotify categories for Switzerland. Documentation at this link: [https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-categories](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-categories)


```{r}
# Set up the endpoint and parameters
url_cats <- "https://api.spotify.com/v1/browse/categories"
params <- list(
  country = "CH",
  limit = 10
)

# Make the GET request
response <- GET(url_cats, 
                query = params, 
                add_headers("Authorization" = authorization_header))

# Process the response
cats <- content(response, as = "parsed", encoding = "UTF-8")

cats[[1]]$items[[1]]$name    # name
cats[[1]]$items[[1]]$id      # id
cats[[1]]$items[[1]]$href    # url for the endpoint

# Let's create a data frame `categories` extracting all the genres:
ids <- names <- hrefs <- vector(mode = "character", length = 10)
for (i in 1:10) {
  ids[i] <- cats[[1]]$items[[i]]$id
  names[i] <- cats[[1]]$items[[i]]$name
  hrefs[i] <- cats[[1]]$items[[i]]$href
}
categories <- tibble(names = names, hrefs = hrefs, id = ids)
categories
```



# Get categories' playlists: Rock

This is described here: [https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-a-categories-playlists](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-a-categories-playlists). The endpoints are: `"https://api.spotify.com/v1/browse/categories/{category_id}/playlists"`. 

```{r}
# Get the category id:
categories$id[categories$names=="Rock"] # 0JQ5DAqbMKFDXXwE9BDJAr

# Same thing in tidyverse R langugage would be: 
# categories %>% filter(names=="Rock") %>% select(id) %>% as.character()   

url_rock <- str_c("https://api.spotify.com/v1/browse/categories/", categories$id[categories$names=="Rock"],"/playlists")
params <- list(
  country = "CH",
  limit = 10
)

# Make the GET request
rock_r <- GET(url_rock, query = params, 
              add_headers("Authorization" = authorization_header))
rock <- content(rock_r, as = "parsed", encoding = "UTF-8")

# Get one playlist:
rock$playlists$items[[1]]
rock$playlists$items[[1]]$id

# Collect songs from Rock playlists
# https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-playlist
url_plls <- str_c("https://api.spotify.com/v1/playlists/", rock$playlists$items[[1]]$id)
plls_r <- GET(url_plls, query = params, 
              add_headers("Authorization" = authorization_header))
plls <- content(plls_r, as = "parsed", encoding = "UTF-8")

# Get songs IDs:
id = plls$tracks$items[[1]]$track$id

```

You can continue inspecting the documentation and scraping from other endpoints. You can think of various applications including various songs or artists. You can, of course, loop over many items (songs, genres, playlists...)
